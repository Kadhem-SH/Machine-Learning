Lab 2 – Mobile Price Classification

Dataset

We used the (Mobile Price Classification) dataset which contains features of mobile phones such as battery power, memory, camera, and connectivity options.

Objective

The aim of this lab is to explore the dataset and understand its structure before applying machine learning algorithms.

Steps Performed

* Loaded the dataset using Python (Pandas).
* Displayed dataset shape and columns.
* Checked data types and basic information.
* Viewed sample rows using `head()`.
* Designed a simple ML workflow diagram.

Files Included

* `Lab2_MobilePrice.ipynb` → Python notebook for data exploration.
* `test.csv` → Dataset used in the lab.
* `image.png` → Workflow diagram.
